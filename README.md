# Ray Casting Game with MiniLibX Library in C

This project aims to develop a ray casting game using the MiniLibX library in the C programming language.

## Overview

The ray casting game is a 2D game that utilizes the concept of ray casting to create a graphical representation of a 3D environment. The objective is to provide an immersive and interactive gaming experience where players navigate through a virtual environment.

## Features

- Ray Casting Engine: Renders the 2D environment using ray casting techniques.
- Player Interaction: Enables player movement, interactions, and object collection.
- Collision Detection: Detects collisions with walls and obstacles for realistic player interaction.
- Game Mechanics: Implements puzzles, challenges, and objectives for an engaging gameplay experience.
- User Interface: Displays game-related information using the MiniLibX library, including HUD and menus.
- Game State Management: Handles game states, such as starting, pausing, and ending the game.
- Audio Support: Incorporates sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C
- MiniLibX Library: Graphical rendering and user interface development.
